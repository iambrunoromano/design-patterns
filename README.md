# Creational Design Patterns

## Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory design pattern provides and easy way to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
The case is you have several classes that behave in a similar way but differ for what they do represent:
```
public class SomeClassFirstVersion{
    public void doSomething(){}
}

public class SomeClassSecondVersion{
    public void doSomething(){}
}

public class SomeClassThirdVersion{
    public void doSomething(){}
}
```
## Builder
## Factory Method
The Factory method design pattern provides an easy introduction for new classes of objects that offer similar functionality with respect to the previous ones. 
## Prototype
## Singleton
## Abstract Factory

# Structural Design Patterns

## Adapter
## Bridge
